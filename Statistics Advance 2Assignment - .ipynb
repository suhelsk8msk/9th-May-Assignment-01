    "\n",
    "Independence: The observations in the sample must be independent of each other. This means that the value of one observation should not depend on the value of another observation. Independence ensures that the sample is representative of the population and that the observations are not influenced by each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identically Distributed: The observations must be identically distributed, meaning that they are drawn from the same probability distribution with the same parameters. This ensures that each observation is sampled from the same underlying population and that the distribution of the sample mean converges to a single limiting distribution as the sample size increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finite Variance: The population distribution from which the observations are drawn must have a finite variance. This ensures that the sample mean has a well-defined variance, which is necessary for the convergence of the sample mean distribution to the normal distribution as the sample size increases.\n",
