    "Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. It provides methods for summarizing and describing data sets, as well as techniques for making inferences and predictions based on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, statistics involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 -Data Collection: Gathering information or observations from a population or sample using various methods such as surveys, experiments, or observational studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2- Data Organization: Organizing the collected data in a systematic and meaningful way, which may involve tabulation, classification, or graphical representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 -Descriptive Statistics: Describing the main features of a dataset through summary measures such as measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation).\n",
    "\n",
    "4 - Inferential Statistics: Making inferences or predictions about a population based on sample data. This involves using probability theory and statistical models to draw conclusions and make decisions in the presence of uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "5- Hypothesis Testing: Evaluating hypotheses or claims about a population parameter using sample data. This includes procedures to assess the strength of evidence against a null hypothesis and make decisions based on the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "6 - Regression Analysis: Examining the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable, allowing for prediction and understanding of how changes in one variable may affect another.\n",
    "\n",
    "7 -Probability: The foundation of statistics, probability theory deals with the likelihood of events occurring and provides the mathematical framework for statistical inference."
