    "Ans - In a typical SQL query, the clauses are executed in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 - SELECT: The SELECT clause is used to specify the columns that should be retrieved in the result set. It is the first clause to be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - FROM: The FROM clause specifies the table or tables from which the data should be retrieved. After the SELECT clause, the database engine determines the source of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 - JOIN: If the query involves multiple tables, the JOIN clause is used to combine rows from different tables based on a related column between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "WHERE: The WHERE clause is used to filter the rows that satisfy a given condition. It is applied after the data is retrieved from the tables specified in the FROM clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "GROUP BY: The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows based on the values in one or more columns. It is often used in conjunction with aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "HAVING: The HAVING clause filters the results of the GROUP BY clause based on a specified condition. It is similar to the WHERE clause but is used specifically with aggregated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT (again): Additional columns or expressions can be selected after the initial SELECT clause. This can include calculated values, aliases, or other expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORDER BY: The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set based on one or more columns, either in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.\n",
    "\n",
    "LIMIT/OFFSET (optional): The LIMIT clause is used to restrict the number of rows in the result set, and the OFFSET clause is used to skip a specific number of rows. These are often used for pagination or to limit the amount of data returned."
