    "Measures of dispersion, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, are used to describe the spread or variability of a dataset. They provide insight into how the data points are distributed around the central tendency measures (mean, median, or mode). Here's how each of these measures is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Range:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range is the simplest measure of dispersion and is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset.\n",
    "It gives a rough idea of how spread out the data points are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If you have a dataset of test scores ranging from 60 to 90, the range would be 90 - 60 = 30, indicating that the scores vary by 30 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance measures how much each data point in a dataset differs from the mean of the dataset.\n",
    "It's calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean.\n",
    "Variance gives a more precise measure of dispersion compared to range.\n",
    "However, it's in squared units, which might not be intuitive for interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If you have a dataset of exam scores with a mean of 75, and the variance is calculated to be 100, it means that, on average, each score deviates from the mean by approximately 10 points squared.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Standard Deviation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard deviation is the square root of the variance and provides a measure of dispersion in the same units as the original data.\n",
    "It indicates how much the data points deviate from the mean.\n",
    "Standard deviation is widely used because it's more interpretable than variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If the standard deviation of a set of IQ scores is calculated to be 15, it means that, on average, IQ scores deviate from the mean IQ score by approximately 15 points."

    " ## Mean:\n",
    " Outliers can disproportionately influence the mean because it considers every value in the dataset. If there are extreme values, particularly those that are significantly higher or lower than the rest of the data, the mean will be pulled towards them. This can lead to an overestimation or underestimation of the typical value in the dataset.\n",

    "## Mode:\n",
    "Outliers typically have little effect on the mode, as it represents the most frequently occurring value(s) in the dataset. However, if there are outliers that occur with high frequency, they could potentially influence the mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2 Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: Outliers can greatly affect the range because it is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. If there are outliers, particularly extreme values, they will increase the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance and Standard Deviation: Outliers can inflate the variance and standard deviation because these measures calculate the dispersion of data points around the mean. Outliers increase the deviation of data points from the mean, resulting in higher variance and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interquartile Range (IQR): The IQR, which measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data, is less influenced by outliers compared to the range, variance, and standard deviation. Outliers affect only the extremes of the dataset, so the IQR provides a more robust measure of dispersion in the presence of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "Consider a dataset of exam scores: {75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105}. If an outlier of 200 is added to the dataset, the impact on measures of central tendency and dispersion would be as follows:\n",
